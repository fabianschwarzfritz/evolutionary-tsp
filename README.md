Travelling Salesman Problem
======================================

This repository contains a simple, pure JavaScript implementation of an evolutionary algorithm
solving the [Travelling Salesman Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem) ("TSP").

The group of algorithms is also known as "genetic algorithms".

Reading Links
----
Here are a few links to resources I read along the way:
 - wikipedia: [TSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem);
 - towardsdatascience: [Evolution of a salesman: A complete genetic algorithm tutorial for Python](https://towardsdatascience.com/evolution-of-a-salesman-a-complete-genetic-algorithm-tutorial-for-python-6fe5d2b3ca35);

Installation and Dependencies
---
I wanted to focus on the algorithm rather than managing dependencies, building, and pipelines.
No dependencies, no package manger.

At the point of development this runs with NodeJS version
```bash
➜  evolution git:(main) ✗ node --version
v10.15.3
```
